## 🖥️ RDP Monitoring & Geo-Map Dashboard
<a name="rdp-monitoring--geo-map-dashboard"></a>

**Description:**  
This project demonstrates monitoring of successful and failed RDP logins on a Windows EC2 instance using Splunk Cloud. It includes single-value dashboards for login counts and a geo-map for failed attempts.

**Key Features:**
- Captures **failed and successful RDP login events** from Windows Security Event Logs.
- Provides **real-time dashboards** with single-value counters.
- Visualizes **failed login attempts on a world map** using IP geolocation.
- Supports **simulated attack data** to validate geo-mapping and dashboard functionality.
